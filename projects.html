				<h1>Fine-Tuning Games</h1>
				<h3>There is palpable excitement about AI models that are trained, supposedly for “general purpose.” But in order for these technologies to reach the market, they must first be tweaked and fine-tuned for particular, domain-specific use. In this project, we put forward a model of this adaptation process, highlighting the latent strategic dynamics that arise when one entity builds a general technology that other entities may tune and specialize. Our analysis suggests how some domains will or won’t adapt a general-purpose model. Depending on the cost of investment, a domain might either “abstain,” “contribute,” or “free-ride.”</h3>

				<h1>Computer Vision for Helmet Detection</h1>
				<h3>Bike, scooter and moped sharing companies' biggest challenge is rider safety in car-dominated cities. To encourage riders to wear helmets, we built a computer vision model that can detect whether a rider is wearing a helmet in real time. We can use this feature to motivate helmet-wearing through discounts, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_(book)">nudge</a> effect, or strict requirement (in certain markets). We scraped images from Google, built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using transferred learning with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10934">YOLOv4</a>, and designed and implemented the UI for the Lime app. The model's classification accuracy on a test set was 97.55%.

This event spurred significant debate not about any underlying political issue but about the squares themselves. A defining feature of the Internet is its self-referentiality.

				<h1>Recursion and Gothic Architecture</h1>

				<h3>Much of gothic architecture was built before computers existed. However, gothic structures exhibit self-similarity on different scales. Mathematicians and Computer Scientists describe this as "fractal" or adhering to "recursive logic." Using just a few lines of code, I design relatively ornate elements of a cathedral.</h3>

Which states perform better than other states, and why? How do these metrics correlate with partisan state leanings, income level, and other census information?</h3>

				<h1>Controlling Horse Populations in the Western United States</h1>
				<h3>Feral horse populations are exploding, and the Bureau of Land Management refrains from culling because of its unpopularity. Instead, they gather large number of horses and keep them in barns. From a population dynamics perspective, we find that the current strategy is inadequate and simulate the impacts of a number of proposed alternatives.</h3>

				<h1>Statistical Methods for Detecting Magnetic Reconnection Events using NASA Spacecraft Data</h1>
				<h3>During an 8-month research assistantship at <a href="https://www.pppl.gov/">Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory</a> under Dr. Masaaki Yamada, I implemented a <a href="http://www.issibern.ch/forads/sr-001-08.pdf">minimum variance analysis (MVA)</a> technique to detect <a href="https://mrx.pppl.gov/Physics/physics.html#:~:text=Magnetic%20reconnection%20(henceforth%20called%20%22reconnection,events%20in%20our%20solar%20system.">magnetic reconnection</a> events in space. This work calibrated magnetic recordings from the four spacecraft launched by <a /href="https://mms.gsfc.nasa.gov/">NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission</a>. From the data I identified ~30 candidates as likely reconnection events, which were further analyzed by the lab. Understanding reconnection is a key part of developing nuclear fusion energy here on earth.</h3>
